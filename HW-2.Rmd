## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Any comments you have:



## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

First, we can create a dummy variable for sex called "is_female" and convert last_online into date format, which might come in handy in some situations.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
# Define an indicator variable is_female
profiles <- profiles %>%
  mutate(is_female = ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(
    last_online = stringr::str_sub(last_online, 1, 10),
    last_online = lubridate::ymd(last_online)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(job = fct_recode(job,
                          "Art" = "artistic / musical / writer",
                          "Bank" = "banking / financial / real estate",
                          "Adm" = "clerical / administrative",
                          "Comp." = "computer / hardware / software",
                          "Build" = "construction / craftsmanship",

                          "Mgmt" =  "executive / management",
                          "Travel" = "hospitality / travel",
                          "Law" =  "law / legal services",
                          "Med" = "medicine / health",
                          "Mil" = "military",
                          "Other" = "other",

                          "Trans" = "transportation",
                          "Unemp" = "unemployed"
                           )) %>% 
  mutate(body_type = fct_recode(body_type,
                                "Extra" = "a little extra",
                                "Over" = "overweight",
                                "Sec." = "rather not say"
                                ))

### Income:

### Body Type:
